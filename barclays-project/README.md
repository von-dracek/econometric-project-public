# Energy rating project

### Introduction

Due to the changing climate and looming energy crisis, the energy efficiency of buildings
is more important than it ever was before. Particularly, it might be a deciding factor
when applying for mortgages in the UK in the future due to regulations, since according
to Open Data Communities, close to 40% of the UKâ€™s energy consumption and emissions
are produced from the heating and usage of buildings.
To manage risk well, banks need to be able to predict the energy rating for buildings
for which the energy rating has not yet been determined.


Our task was to build a model that predicts the energy rating of a building based on
available data. Particularly, we were tasked to compare several models that can be used
to predict the energy rating and then choose the one with the best accuracy.
Furthermore, the data that are available to the client are rather limited, containing
only a few regressors. We were thus also tasked to identify potentially useful regressors
that are not currently used by the client and that could be included in the model to
increase the accuracy.
